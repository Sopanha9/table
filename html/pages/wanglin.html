      Born with a weak body, Wang Lin's features begin as average before becoming moderately handsome as a high grade cultivator. He was born with black hair and black eyes but the former turned white for the first time after studying for 7 years in the Restriction Mountain Trial on Planet Suzaku.[9] Later on, the hair of his Ancient God original body turned red from all the killing intent it accumulated while the cultivation avatar regained black hair. In the end, it became definitely white after the second Vermilion Bird Mark Awakening. It can be seen as a testimony of his harsh life which was filled with life and death situations, tragedies and losses, making Wang Lin regards himself as an old man even though he still possessed a long lifespan.
