      <p><b>Xiao Yan </b>is the main protagonist of <mark>Battle Through the Heavens</mark>, and reincarnated from Earth, but the author did not give information about his life on Earth. He was once hailed as a genius as a child but was called trash ever since Yao Lao resided in the ring his mother gave to him before she died. He then later sets out on a journey to become stronger. At first, his goal was just to be able to defeat Nalan Yanran, but his final goal has risen much higher as his enemies are at the top of the "food-chain" and he realizes he will have to surpass them. His aim is to reach Dou Di ( Battle God ), which is the highest rank.</p>
